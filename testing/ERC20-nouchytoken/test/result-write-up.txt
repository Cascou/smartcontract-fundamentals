NouchyToken: Write Up
-------------------------------------------------------

-> Solhint: 
There were no recommended changes to be made after using Solhint.

-> Prettier:
The code was refactored to look better after running the prettier plugin.

-> Slither:
There were some re-entrancy issue noticed for the sellback and withdraw ether function: Fixed.
There were some version constraint issues with the openzeppelin contracts

{0: Version constraint ^0.8.20 contains known severe issues (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bugs.html)      
        - VerbatimInvalidDeduplication
        - FullInlinerNonExpressionSplitArgumentEvaluationOrder
        - MissingSideEffectsOnSelectorAcce
}

Chose to ignore them.

Low level call in withdrawEther and Sellback i.e. (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: refundAmount}("");
-> False positives, so ignored

Max Supply constant declared but never used: Fixed by removing.

-> Code Coverage: 97%
reasons why not 100%, there was a Modifier of owner which I could not bypass with contract.
